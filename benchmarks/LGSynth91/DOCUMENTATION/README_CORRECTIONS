A total of seven ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits have been modified. Four of the
seven circuits have been modified to eliminate flip-flops that were unreachable
by any path starting at the primary inputs. This was accomplished by removing
selected flip-flops from the circuit and declaring these flip-flop inputs and
outputs to be primary outputs and inputs, respectively. The affected circuits
are s9234, s13207, s15850 and s38584. The other three circuits modified are
digital fraction multipliers that were functionally incorrect. The affected
circuits are s208, s420 and s838. All seven circuits have been renamed to
add a .1 suffix to their names. For example, the corrected version of s208
is named s208.1. The old versions of these circuits will no longer be
distributed as part of the ISCAS'89 benchmarks.
